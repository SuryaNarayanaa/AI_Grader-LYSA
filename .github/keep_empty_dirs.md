# Empty Directory Tracking

Empty directories in this project contain `.gitkeep` files to ensure they are tracked by Git.
This is necessary because Git doesn't track empty directories by default.

## Why This Matters

The project structure depends on these directories being present, even when they're initially empty,
to ensure proper functionality when files are later added during normal operation.
